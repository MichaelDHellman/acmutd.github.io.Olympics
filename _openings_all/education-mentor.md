Are you a junior, senior, or graduate student (who has done their undergrad at UTD) looking to pass on advice and help others navigate UTD? Join the ACM Mentor Program!

By joining our program, you will be paired with an underclassmen student who you commit to meeting at least once a month for the Fall semester. This is a great opportunity to pass on what you've learned about the CS community at UTD, build relationships, and meet new people! You will also get perks such as access to resources such as Udemy courses to learn a new skill, monthly socials to meet other students, and exclusive workshops on topics such as resumes and LinkedIn for personalized feedback.

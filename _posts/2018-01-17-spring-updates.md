Welcome back to a chilly spring semester! We have a bunch of exciting updates to share with you for the new year.

<!--more-->

#### ACM Blog

Welcome to our first blog post! We've made it easier for you to keep up with everything ACM is doing. You'll be able to see what's happening behind-the-scenes of every one of our divisions.

#### ACM Labs

ACM Labs is relaunching this semester as ACM's research and development division. Our goal is to encourage students to experiment with the latest technologies, without having to worry about financial constraints. Bring us an innovative project idea and we'll fund up to 100% of the project's costs.

We'll share more details at our ACM Spring Kick-off on January 18th.

#### HackUTD

HackUTD is ACM's annual hackathon and this year it'll be bigger than ever! We will be opening registration very soon, so keep an eye out for that.

We can't wait to see y'all at our upcoming events! Be sure to follow us on all of our social media channels for our latest updates. *Whoosh!*

An interview with the Bitcoin App team of ACM Projects.

#### Meet the Team

Oliver Darne, Taaha Kamal, Devanshi Padsala are the members of ACM Project's Smart Lock team. Sai Pathuri, the director of ACM Projects, is their mentor through this process. I sat down with the team last build night to ask them a few questions.


#### Why did you decide to join ACM Projects?

Oliver: I wanted to have a project that encapsulates my skill set. It's a great talking point in a job interview.

Taaha: I wanted to do something that I wouldn't do normally in school, and also to work on a personal project that I could be committed to.

Devanshi: I wanted to apply what I learned in my classes to a real world project.



#### What's been your biggest challenge so far?

Oliver: Figuring out our group dynamics took a while, but eventually we figured out the best way to divide the work and let everyone play to their strenghts.

Taaha: I never had experiences with the O/R Mapping tools like PeeWee which we use to implement the databse with python. So I read through the documentation in order to get a better idea of how it worked.

Dev:  I wasn't as experienced as my teammates when we started this project. But I've quickly been able to catch up after getting a lot of help from my mentor. It was tough, but by asking a lot of questions and doing a lot of research, I've been able to learn an incredible amount in this short time.

#### What excites you most about your project?

Oliver: Doing something that I haven't done before. I always thought web development would be a good skill to have but I never had a reason for learning it before this.

Taaha: Our project is pretty practicle. I was looking up the prices of smartlocks and all of them are pretty expensive. But buying the parts to make one ourselves was significantly cheaper. So it'll be useful to make one for myself in the future.

Dev: I feel like i learn something brand new every build night and that's been really exciting.


#### What's your favourite videogame?

Oliver: *Civilization V*

Taaha: *Madden NFL 25*

Dev: *Super Mario Bros.*

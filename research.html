                ACM Research is a semester-long, research-based initiative for
                students who want to explore various subfields in computer

                advisor throughout the semester to successfully create a
                tangible research project.

                <p>
                  The first step is to fill out our application. Our application
                  consists of general questions intended to give us insight into
                  your previous development and leadership experience. Next,
                  you'll be followed up with a coding challenge. You can explore
                  our challenges from past semesters
                  <a href="https://github.com/ACM-Research/Coding-Challenge-S22"
                    >here</a
                  >
                  for Spring 2022 and
                  <a href="https://github.com/ACM-Research/Coding-Challenge-F21"
                    >here</a
                  >
                  for Fall 2021. From these applications, we select the most
                  promising candidates for one-on-one interviews. The interview
                  is the last step of the application process. Based on the
                  application and interview, we select the very best candidates
                  to create around 5 teams of 5 people.

                <p>
                  ACM Research is designed for those new to performing academic
                  research. We do not require prior research experience but we
                  do recommend being familiar with a moderate level of software
                  development. If you are able to work on the coding challenge
                  then you should have no issues in participating in ACM
                  Research.

                <p>
                  Be genuine! We want to see your passion for research and
                  desire to be curious. We can only judge your experience and
                  character based on what we see in the application, so fill all
                  of the questions out! Leaving questions blank is a lost
                  opportunity for us to learn more about you.

                <h4>How is ACM Research structured?</h4>
                <p>
                  You will be placed into a team of approximately five students
                  with a project and a research lead (who is a past ACM Research
                  participant). Additionally, each team will be supported by a
                  professor who will serve to mentor the team in conducting
                  research. We will have weekly (and mandatory) build nights
                  every Monday from 8:30 pm - 10:00 pm. This is time for you to
                  work with your team, meet with your mentor and learn. Some
                  build nights may include a short tech-related workshop
                  designed to diversify your tech skills.

                <h4>What is the time commitment?</h4>
                <p>
                  The minimum time commitment is the 1.5 hours required for each
                  weekly build night. Beyond this, you and your team may need
                  extra time to complete your project so it's up to you to
                  schedule the time amongst yourselves.

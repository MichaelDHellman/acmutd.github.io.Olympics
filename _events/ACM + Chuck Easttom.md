description: "This lecture provides an overview of the current state of quantum computing and what impact it will have on cryptography. The cryptographic algorithms that are believed to be resistant to quantum computing are briefly explored. There is discussion of the current NIST efforts to standardize post-quantum cryptography. The focus will be on lattice-based cryptographic solutions, both as a post-quantum solution, and as potentially more robust to current asymmetric cryptography needs."

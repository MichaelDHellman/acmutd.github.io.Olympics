HackUTD, the largest university hackathon in North Texas, is a weekend long event where students build apps, hardware, and more. HackUTD provides a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with varying technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch.

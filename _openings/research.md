ACM Research is a semester-long, research-based initiative for students who want to explore various subfields in computer science. You will be guided by a research lead and faculty advisor throughout the semester to successfully create a tangible research project.

Applications will close on September 6th at 11:59 CST. There will be a coding challenge in the application process and we will be sending them out on a rolling basis daily. We highly recommend applying ASAP or you will NOT have enough time to work on the coding challenge.

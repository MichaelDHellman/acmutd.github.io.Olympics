ACM Labs funds student projects to promote experimentation with cutting-edge technologies.Â If you have a cool project idea, apply here for the chance to get funded for up to 100% of your project costs. We expect you to have worked on software/hardware projects in the past. If you are a beginner looking to get more experience with development, check out ACM Projects, our guided projects initiative.

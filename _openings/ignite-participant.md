ACM Ignite is a semester long business & tech development program to help experienced students build a marketable product. 
Ignite will be largely self-guided, so we're looking for people with past projects and/or work experience. See ACM Projects for beginners.
The deadline for this application is Aug 28th, 2019 at 11:59 CST.
